    <h2>üíå To my dear Moon Taeil:</h2>
    <p>
      Taeil, how are you? This question keeps coming to my mind really often. I worry a lot because you are important to me, and I just want to know you are doing fine.
      It's been 8 years since I met you for the first time. Not many know this but what got me was your smile, I kept thinking about it until many days later so I became your fan. I entered to an event and by the end I got my favorite group and artist.
      Through those years I discovered what it feels like when someone helps you bright your day with something so simple still really magical like singing and making content.
      As time passed I also got to know a little more about your personality and character. Also I saw how much you enjoyed singing and being on the stage. And how much people ment to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your voice has this warm effect that evokes different emotions with each song. I like it very much, you help me find calm when the world feels too much. Thanks to you I got myself out of a loop that hurt for a long time way too familiar and got me thinking that the best way was keeping living like that.
      I want to thank you for being in my life for these past years, and for making great and beautiful memories together. I know things are complicated right now, still I want to make something special for someone special. I hope you gain strength and feel the deep appreciation and love Moondanses feel for you.
      I truthfully hope you can return to sing and develope yourself in as many aspects as you want. Keep creting dreams and fulfilling them.
      I believe in you so I promise I'll promise to keep cheering for you and being by your side no matter how the path might turn ‚ù£Ô∏è
    </p>
    <p>
      I am really thankful to have met you.
      I love you, I miss you. Happy Birthday my Moon üçÄ
    </p>
